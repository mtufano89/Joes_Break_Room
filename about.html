      <h2 class="section-title">Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Joe’s Break Room is an online shop built for people who love collectibles.
        We focus on sports and Pokémon cards, carefully curating singles and graded
        cards so you don’t have to dig through endless bulk or overpay for “mystery” lots.
      </p>
      <p>
        With years in the hobby, we know what collectors actually want to see — clean
        cards, clear photos, honest descriptions, and prices that make sense. Whether
        you’re chasing a specific player, rounding out a set, or just browsing for
        something cool, we’ve already done the hunting for the gems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a laid-back space for anyone who enjoys collecting and wants a
        respectable, knowledgeable source they can trust.

          <h3>Great Communication</h3>
          <p>
            Have a question about condition, centering, or comps? We actually answer.
            Clear, honest communication so you always know what you’re getting.

        <div class="feature-card">
          <h3>Fast Shipping</h3>
          <p>
            Cards are packed securely and shipped quickly, because waiting forever for
            a mail day is the worst.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>Great Prices</h3>
          <p>
            Collector-friendly pricing on raw and graded cards. We’d rather build
            long-term relationships than squeeze every dollar out of a single sale.

        At the end of the day, this is a hobby. Joe’s Break Room is meant to feel like
        hanging out with other collectors — not fighting bots, not stressing over retail
        drops. Just a chill place to find cards you love, talk the hobby, and enjoy the ride.
